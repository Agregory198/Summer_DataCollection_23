# Summer_DataCollection_23
Files containing data I recorded from the Hoffmans' Cave archeological assemblage (University of Cape Town) and Matjies River assemblage (Bloemfontein).

In this repository I have two congiguration (.cfg) files that conatin coded attributes I used to record core and backed tool attributes, respectively (cores.cfg, Backed_tools.cfg). I used these configuration files in the software E4 (https://www.oldstoneage.com/osa/tech/e4/) to keep track of the stone tool attributes. The exported files are saved as an excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) file for both cores and the backed tools, respectively.

This repositor also contains a text file from the Southern African Radiocarbon Database (SARD). This text file was downloaded from https://github.com/emmaloftus/Southern-African-Radiocarbon-Database last updated in March of the year 2021.
